This is the AssetDescription class. This is to contain all the descriptions for
object constructors and is called from the (FILE- Spaceship.java),
and (FILE- Lifeform.java). I did this souly to make my main look much more streamline. I also
like having all these assets in one file and organized. This class is now the super class for
the spaceships, lifeforms, and locations with that said. The classes of lifeforms and spaceship
get overloaded the arguments. The class using locations is now used with inheritance.
